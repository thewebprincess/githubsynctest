Note that you will probably want to test this page in conjunction with the <strong>Home</strong> page.

To test this page:
<ul>
	<li>Navigate to <strong><em>Settings &gt; Reading</em></strong> in the WordPress admin.</li>
	<li>Then use the settings in the screenshot below.</li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1071" alt="Static Pages" src="http://githubsync.dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/static-pages.png" width="1390" height="1022" />

A few things to check once this is done.
<ul>
	<li>Navigating to the Blog page does <strong>not</strong> display this page. It should display blog posts.</li>
	<li>Check that the browser window / tab name is what you intend it to show.</li>
	<li>If your theme displays breadcrumbs, they should probably not show when this is the posts page.</li>
</ul>
